# FortniteLauncher
Simple Fortnite launcher which bypasses EAC and allows for dll injection, it also allows for efficiently using Epic's services on older builds!

# CREATOR TO-DO
I soon will add more flexibility, such as auto exchange grabbing and more.

# CLIENT TO-DO
You **need** an exchange code generator, this can be done using https://github.com/ThisNils/exchange-code-generator, a Discord bot like Carbide or AK47, or the manual way.


# CREDIT
Me: Maintaining the launcher.  
VastBlast: NiteStats, which is used to grab the FLToken.

# EXTRA
If you have any issues, feel free to contact me on Discord at: ozne#3303
